# Image for "Improving NN Interpretability via Rule Extraction"

##Supporting images, "2D embeddings":

* [Owl classification rule - red heatmap](./owl_scatter_plot_features.jpg)
* [Owl classification rule - feature mask](./owl_scatter_plot_masked.jpg)

##Supporting images, "Accuracy comparison between classes":
* [Random Forest, Perceptron, Top5, Top10 accuracy](./classes_all_accuracy_histogram.pdf). The dataset has been selected so that VGG-16 fully connected layers have an accuracy = 100%.
