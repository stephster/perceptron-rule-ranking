# Images for "Improving NN Interpretability via Rule Extraction"

## Supporting images, "2D embeddings":

* [Owl classification rule - red heatmap](./owl_scatter_plot_features.jpg). We tint the image (in red color) using filters activations. The image is split in 4 quadrants, the top-right quadrant is where the rule is activated.
* [Owl classification rule - feature mask](./owl_scatter_plot_masked.jpg). We mask the image using filter activations.

## Supporting images, "Accuracy comparison between classes":
* [Random Forest, Perceptron, Top5, Top10 accuracy](./classes_all_accuracy_histogram.pdf). The dataset has been selected so that the accuracy of VGG-16 fully connected layers is 100% (VGG-16 is the benchmark).
